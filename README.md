# Tumor Cancer Prediction

# Description

A tumor is an abnormal lump or growth of cells. When the cells in the tumor are normal, it is benign. Then something just went wrong, and they overgrew and produced a lump. When the cells are abnormal and can grow uncontrollably, then they are cancerous cells, and the tumor is malignant. 
The early diagnosis of the tumor can improve the prognosis and chance of treatment significantly, as it can promote timely clinical treatment to patients. Further accurate classification of benign tumors can prevent patients undergoing unnecessary treatments.

# Objective

The main objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict the patient diagnosis based on the given features.

# Machine Learning Models

- Logistic Regression
- SVM
- ID3
- Naive Bayes
- KNN

# Features

- A simple GUI window to show the prediction.
